The company is a NSF  SBIR funded startup specializing in Java solutions for safety-critical and  mixed-criticality avionics systems. The students' key accomplishments include  the first deployed real-time Java virtual machine on the Boeing-Insitu ScanEagle  UAV and a collaboration with the European Space Agency to evaluate real-time  Java for Aerospace applications. Currently they are working on turning our  research into a small, simple, high-performance product, called the  Fiji VM.</p><p align="center" class="style1"><img src="ngt.jpg" width="300" /></p><p class="style1">Java is, arguably, the most widely used computer programming language in the  broader IT industry. The value proposition for Java in avionics is as follows.  Avionics systems are increasing in complexity, in particular due to the steadily  increasing role of software, and the need for more scalable approaches to avionics  design is reaching critical mass. We see Java as the next step in the evolution  of avionics, given its inherent safety guarantees which will enable quicker  certification, as well as its natural ability to support hardware partitioning  to allow mixed-criticality software to run on a single CPU without requiring  additional hardware or operating system support. With the Fiji VM technology,  both safety-critical vehicle software, and higher-level mission software may  be written in Java, with partitioning being provided statically by the language.  Developers may choose between using only minimal Java features (as would be  appropriate for vehicle systems) or using the standard Java libraries for various  high-level algorithms (for mission systems).</p><p class="style1">The Fiji VM technology is stable  and supports  a wide variety of platforms, including PowerPC platforms like what is used  in the F-35. Pperformance exceeds that of the leading commercial real-time  Java systems from IBM and Sun, while supporting smaller hardware platforms.  Fiji VM has already been demonstrated running full Java software,with real-time  support enabled, on systems ranging from embedded hardware running RTEMS (Real  Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems used by the European Space Agency)  to large multi-processor Linux server systems.</p></body></html>
