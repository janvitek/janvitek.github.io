## Data Acquision

Let's get us some data.  The work this week is to acquire data on 1,000 projects
from GitHub and store them in the database that you have designed in A2.

### Which Projects?

We leave it up to you decide on criteria for inclusion of projects that will
be "interesting" to analyze in future assignments. Clearly, the projects 
should be representative (ie. if they are all class assignments that is not
likely the case), they should contain code (there are many repositories that
do not), etc. 

### Statistics

To make sure that you have useable data in your database, run some queries
to compute things like the size of the code (e.g. additions and deletions for
each file), the number of developers, the lenght of time the project is active.
Pick some simple way to present the results.

### Deliverables

Write a short report describing how you selected the projects and give some
statistics on the projects (e.g. size or active duration).

Add a new directory to your `EDS19` repository on GitHub with the following
contents:

 * `03-acquire/report.rmd` - the report for this assignment,
 * `03-acquire/projs.txt` - the list of acquired projects

Due to size, do not commit the projects or your databased.

The work should be completed Thursday February 7th. If you get stuck or have
difficulties with any part of this, do not hesitate to ask the course staff or
colleagues.
