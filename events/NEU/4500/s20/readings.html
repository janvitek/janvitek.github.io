programming" of the following book:</p><ul><li><p>Weinberg. <span style="font-style: italic">The Psychology of Computer Programming</span>. Vab
Nostrand Reinhold Co., 1971</p><p>This incredibly old book contains a lot of astute observations about the
relationship between code and its creator, the software developer. Don&rsquo;t
get scared just because it uses code snippets from one of the worst
languages ever designed (Hopper&rsquo;s COBOL). The observations, and Weinberg&rsquo;s
suggestions on how to think about/react to them are good ones.</p></li></ul><p>The following lists of (also old) books and book chapters cover many of the
ideas from this course:</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>Gamma, Helm, Johnson,  Vlissides. <span style="font-style: italic">Design
Patterns</span>. Addison-Wesley, 1995</p><p>Northeastern&rsquo;s library makes
<a href="https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NEU_ALMA51284137790001401&amp;context=L&amp;vid=NU&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US">the
on-line version</a> available to all students.</p><p>While editors keep dictionaries and style guides on their shelves,
beginning software developers put this book on their desk. </p></li><li><p>Beck. <span style="font-style: italic">Extreme Programming Explained</span>. Addison-Wesley, 1999</p><p>Beck is one of the first "explainers" of test-driven and extreme
programming. He picked it up from 1980s academics, with whom he shared lab
space in the 1990s. This book explains the whole eco-system of test-driven,
example-driven, iterative software design and coins the phrase "extreme"
programming. The philosophies are reminiscent of those of Fundamentals I
and II&#8212;<wbr></wbr>scaled to size.</p><p>The book is a handy reference of how to approach software development in
this style, though it could have been written as a 10 page essay.</p><p>Beck also wrote an equally concise book on agile programming. You may wish
to look into this one, too.</p></li><li><p>Williams, Kesler. <span style="font-style: italic">Pair Programming Illuminated.</span>
Addison-Wesley, 2002</p><p>Williams conducted extensive research under Keller&rsquo;s guidance on pair
programming: the what, the how, its benefits, its potential downsides, the
common misunderstandings, etc. This book presents her dissertation results
as an easily accessible guide to the practice.</p></li><li><p>Fowler, Scott. <span style="font-style: italic">UML Distilled</span>. Addison-Wesley, 1997</p><p>For better or worse, you will encounter UML during your career. This book
is one of many that explains UML and how to use some of it. This course
uses UML simply as a "doodling notation" because you may encounter it in
the real world.  There isn&rsquo;t much to teach about it (until some manager
really insists on it, at which point you may wish to look for a new job).</p></li><li><p>Hunt and Thomas. <span style="font-style: italic">The Pragmatic Programmer</span>. Addison-Wesley, 1999</p><p>Do not stop reading about the practice of software development after you
take your first, second or third job. Keep up with what articulate
developers have to say about creating good software and the practices that
help. This book is an example of this kind of reading, practical and good
advice from experienced programmers in a guru-style manner.</p></li><li><p>Strunk and White. <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/resources.html"><span style="font-style: italic">Elements of Style, 3rd edition</span></a></p><p>You will need to write memos if your investment into your education here is
 to pay off. This little book&#8212;<wbr></wbr>a stand-by for many American editors for
 nearly a century&#8212;<wbr></wbr>will help you express your thoughts in a concise
 manner. It is worth purchasing a copy and keeping it on your desk for the
 rest of your career, right next to an English dictionary. Your books on
 programming and software development will change far more often.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Caveat</span> Some rules in this book give questionable advice.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">An enlightened software developer will eventually read most of these
texts&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and many more&#8212;<wbr></wbr>it is unnecessary to read them to obtain a good
grade (though I may insist on having you read an occasional chapter). Then
again, I assume that college students who take my courses are not in it for
grades but to learn and to prepare themselves for a career.</div></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">End Note</span> On many occasions, CCIS graduates end up in industry
positions where their peers and supervisors do not know of, question, or
reject (intentionally or subconsciously) the ideas and techniques taught in
this course and its prerequisites. Time and again, such graduates have
approached me about how to educate their colleagues in these situations,
because they have seen these ideas work for reasonably large projects. My
best recommendation is to pick and choose readings (chapters, sections,
blogs) from the above or based on the above list. It has the advantage of
presenting the ideas independently of the course(s) and in a form that
targets working programmers. (Nobody knows how to deal with managers for
real.)</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="schedule.html" title="backward to &quot;Schedule&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Software Development&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="lab.html" title="forward to &quot;Lab Book&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
