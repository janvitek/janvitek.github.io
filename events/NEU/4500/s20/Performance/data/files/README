dacapo
  Results from Dacapo 2006 and Dacapo 2009 benchmarks run on OpenJDK Java
  VM.  Sources and compiled code for the benchmarks are available at
  http://www.dacapobench.org/.  Each benchmark was run 3 times, in each run
  repeating 300 iterations.  The benchmarks were run on 64-bit AMD Opteron
  (4x16 cores) with 64G RAM, Linux.

fft_ia64
  Results from FFT benchmark from ftp://ftp.nosc.mil/pub/aburto/fft,
  modified to run multiple iterations in each executions (512 warmup
  iterations are thrown away, 2048 following iterations are recorded). 
  Records a number of hardware performance counters related to execution
  time, cache and TLB performance. The CPU frequency was about 800.179008
  MHz.

  Executed on Itanium CPU with 96K L2 cache, 2M L3 cache running Debian
  Linux, dual-CPU system but the benchmark running on a single processor. 
  100 executions of the benchmark.

fft_p4
  The same FFT benchmark executed on a system with a single Pentium 4 CPU
  with 512K L2 cache running Linux.  The CPU frequency was about 2194.055
  MHz.

ast.out
  Results from R version of the Language Shootout benchmarks, available at
  https://github.com/allr/purdue-fastr/tree/master/test/r/shootout Run in
  GNU-R version 3.0.2 compiled using GCC (default options) on 64-bit Ubuntu
  12.04.  Run on dual-CPU Xeon 2.1GHz, 48G RAM.  As per default, the AST
  interpreter is used to evaluate the benchmarks.  Each benchmark is
  executed 10 times.
    
bc.out
  The same benchmarks run using the byte-code just-in-time compiler and
  byte-code interpreter, at highest optimization level (3).

fft_ia64.out
  One run from the "fft_ia64" data.

fft_p4.out
  One run from the "fft_p4" data.

fop.out
  The DaCapo 2009 fop benchmark run 100 times on a laptop with 64-bit
  Core-i7-3610QM CPU (2.30 GHz), quadcore, 8G RAM - run as shown on slides. 
  The data is indented only for demonstration purposes, no precaution was
  taken to limit interference, avoid frequency scaling, etc.
  
snorm.out
  The Spectralnorm benchmark from the Language Shootout benchmarks for R,
  available at
  https://github.com/allr/purdue-fastr/blob/master/test/r/shootout/spectralnorm/spectralnorm.r
  Run on the same laptop ast fop.out, in the way as shown on slides, using
  the system version of R (3.2.3) in Ubuntu 16.04.  The data is indented
  only for demonstration purposes, no precaution was taken to limit
  interference, avoid frequency scaling, etc. Executed 100 times.
