If the ACM truly cared about ""Good Works"", it would stop trying to run a substandard version of the arXiv, stop trying to run ""Webinars"" for people in ""industry"", etc., and move to a donation model (dues plus an optional top-up donation) to fund any actual ""Good Works"".

I chose ""through increased conference registration costs"", but if we piggybacked on the arXiv, *and* we wanted to ""pay our own way"", the ""increased cost"" would be on the order of $5 per paper.  Compared to current conference fees, $5 is a rounding error.

I'm not convinced we *would* have to pay our own way: many workshops publish their proceedings in EPTCS, which piggybacks on the arXiv and, AFAIK, doesn't pay the arXiv for that privilege.

(Aside: The statement that in Green OA, ""[papers] may not be preserved in perpetuity, and [have] no centralized index"" isn't really true if you put your papers on the arXiv.  Yes, the ACM's publication contract has misleading (intentionally misleading, I suspect) language that tries to make you think you can't—some nonsense about giving me the right to post a ""pre-peer review"" version; that right is not theirs to give or take away.

I am amazed to see $0.8M spent on marketing ($33 for each of the 24k members) and $1.4M on staff costs and overheads.  Looking at the ACM myself I see a lot of ""value add"" work that I consider superfluous.  Having worked as a PC and GC for several conferences I see processes which are cumbersome, bureaucratic, and staff intensive.

A move to OA should be considered alongside the broader evolution or replacement of the publishing system -- either within the context of the existing DL, or within the context of a SIG moving to a separate system in isolation, or within the context of a move to a new umbrella organization in place of the ACM.  (I would make the same observations about the ACM more broadly.)

Concretely, I suggest:

* Extend HotCRP to handle all of the processing needed to collect material for use by the ACM DL -- copyright approvals, bibliographic information, etc.  Pay Eddie or someone with similar programming expertise to do this.  Switch to this as the sole way of adding conferences to the DL.  Interacting with it will be easier for PCs than interacting with the ACM's current systems (removing the need for e.g. publication chairs to be cut-n-pasteing between different ad-hoc formats).  

* Review the way the DL is hosted.  Comparing with commercial AWS prices, the infrastructure costs look massive for the volume of material involved -- is this just in machines at the ACM's expensive NYC HQ?

I thus hardly use the search of the DL.

the search functionality could be imroved, though. searching for keywords does not work well. even when searching for a complete paper title it sometimes failes to find the paper. however, google often delivers links to the ACM DL anyways. so, this is not a real issue -- collaborations with (several) search engine providers would not be a bad idea though.

The model would be something like ArXiv + editorial board + peer-reviewing, or preferrably an interactive version of it: a pre-print is submitted, it is freely downloadable by anybody and any researcher from a supporting institution may post comments or reviews (possibly moderated by editors); in the meantime, the editors send the paper to referees, who may also post their anonimous reviews if they wish; after all designated referees turn in their review (hopefully in a reasonably short period of time), the editor decides whether the paper is accepted, in which case its status changes from ""pre-print"" to ""publication""; in both cases, dowload keeps being free to everybody and posting of comments/further reviews keeps being open to all supporting instiutions.","conferences","yes","yes","yes","they allow long form results;they allow one to present completed research","yes","I think that the importance of conference proceedings in CS is an anomaly that should be corrected.

The online, interactive system I suggest above favors this: a conference submission would actually be a pre-print submitted to an online journal/archive; it is lightly reviewed by the conference PC; after the conference, a selection of papers goes on to the final reviewing process; the accepted papers eventually become ""jpurnal publications"".","3","","","5","","academia","<10 years ago","no","SIGLOG","Europe"

In my view, all scientific research should be openly accessible at all times and to everyone. It is one of the main criteria of science to be reproducible and refutable. If research is not freely accessible, it becomes harder to reproduce it accept by the happy few.

That's an outdated role: we don't need ACM to play that role any more. We all can organize our own conferences and journals and web sites, thank you.

ACM should scale back and focus on the things that we cannot do well ourselves. For example, you could do a better job of helping us to sift through all the bijillions of papers published each year to find the ones that are most interesting and useful. In addition, you could help funding entities to more easily make sense of whether researchers are having a real impact on the world outside academia. And you could apply to NSF for grants of your own to boost efforts to translate research into teaching and practice.

Think of it this way: academic research has uncovered lots of gems--ideas of great value to other scientists, to students, and to the world at large. I don't know of any organization currently focused on discovering those gems and getting them out to the people who need them most. ACM could be that organization.

In the meantime, from what I've seen so far, you have been overly focused on small ideas. You are worried about how you'll protect your market share from the rise of open publishing, how you'll compete. Think bigger. Your role is no longer to be a publisher and conference organizer.

ACM and the DL should always keep in mind that the “content” that makes DL valuable is provided by the scientists OA might seek to ding for publishing it in this manner. I know that the payment is for the nature of the publication (free to readers), but to many it feels like paying ACM to monetize their work.

I am an anti-affiliationist - my identity as a researcher / writer does not depend on who employs me. In the absence of other information, affiliation might provide a clue, but that was more the case when the parts of the scientific world was separated, not when connected by the web / google / etc. Therefore, I favor approaches that make individual subscriptions to the DL more prevalent and more affordable. Although my employer has a subscription to the DL that I can use, I don’t use it and have my own subscription. I find it of high value.

We also publish our proceedings in the DL so that academics can get career credit for their publications. The DL sometimes welcomes us and sometimes doesn’t - mainly because they occasionally decide to believe (very wrongly) that Hillside is an industry promotional group rather than a legally registered educational nonprofit. When we remind the folks at the DL of that, they re-welcome us. This needs to be regularized (not the vacillation, but the publication policy for groups like Hillside).

Similarly, putting the cost on authors discourages putting new knowledge into the pool.

This is all well and good, except ultimately if a given medium refuses to become OA, then scientists are in a bind.  The moral imperative may be to boycott the medium, but if the medium is high-profile then this is self-destructive, to the point of being career suicide for anyone who isn't already well-established.

Conferences and journals should be linked.  Every conference should have a journal special issue, and every paper accepted to the conference (not just a subset of accepted papers) should be invited to the special issue.  The conference will typically have a page limit and the journal will not.  However, there should be no stigma against submitting the conference paper *unchanged* to the special issue.  There should be no ""30% extra material"" requirement.  The journal paper should not be regarded as an ""extended version"" of the conference paper, but as a final version (which may contain extra material beyond the conference paper, or may not).  This way every conference paper can get the in-depth peer review only a journal can provide.","","","","","","academia","<10 years ago","no","","North America"

I'm definitely for OA, but given my desire to advance my career as a PhD student, I need to publish, and I don't have a lot of options for doing so (in my sub-field studying computational narrative, there are 3-5 conferences/year that my work fits well in, and only 1.5 major journals I can think of). My decision to submit something really depends on how my progress lines up with conference deadlines than any single other factor. Waiting six months to a year to submit something in order to publish at a conference that offers OA is not really an option.

That said, I think that Green OA is actually a huge step forward over no OA. My institution happens to have a digital repository where I can make papers available ""in perpetuity"" insofar as that's possible. Not everyone has access to such a service at their institution, but there are also places like arXiv available. I think that in many cases, Green OA achieves the same result as Gold OA for the end-user, especially given search services like Google Scholar that index across the entire web. If someone publishes something and I know an author's name and the title, chances are much greater that I can't access the paper because of a paywall than that it's freely available in some form but I can't find it. Obviously as time goes on and unreliable hosting starts to mean that some Green OA papers aren't available for free any more, there's a problem with that model, but such papers would presumably still be available behind paywalls, so the situation isn't *worse* than the no-OA situation, and if authors retain copyright, where there's demand they'd be able to re-upload old papers.","conferences","yes","yes","yes","they allow long form results;they allow one to present completed research;They have rolling submissions.","I'm not against it, but it doesn't do anything to address the main problem with conferences: fixed submission deadlines.","I recently stopped building my system for a bit in order to rush out a paper describing it in a half-finished state, as opposed to taking the time to finish my system and writing it up once complete. I did this because in CS conference publications are important, and for my work, there are a few conferences with much greater relevance than any of the journals I know about [1]. This kind of behavior is commonplace I think, and it has a real impact on the quality of our communication about our work.

[1] This point is worth emphasizing: in emerging or otherwise marginal subdisciplines, conferences are usually the first venues for publication, followed much later if at all by journals. Computer science as a discipline is fragmented enough and growing in enough directions that conferences have come to dominate the publication model.","2","","","1","I've never used the DL to search for papers.

It is a shame that the journal model in CS seems to be ""second-class"" (both in terms of visibility within CS and to other communities where journal publications are expected).  Other disciplines (such as biology) show that journal publication can be fast, responsive and competitive (reviews within 4-6 weeks, publication within 3 months) but there are few, if any, CS journals like this.

In many countries (outside the US) only journals count from the perspective of track record or promotion, which means that researchers often cannot justify submitting work to conferences, or get appropriate credit for it within their career progression.

I see no reason why the model of VLDB (also adopted by ICLP and apparently now PLDI) of cross-listing the proceedings of major conferences as a ""journal"" should not be adopted more broadly; this might be a better compromise between the expectations of the broader scholarly community and the needs/preferences of CS (conference-centric).","3","3","1","3","DL + Google seems to work perfectly well even without official ""badging"" - I see no reason why ACM should duplicate effort here.","academia","<10 years ago","yes","SIGPLAN, SIGMOD","Europe"

For this, it needs to combine activities that make money (at present, conferences + DL) to fund those that don't (the ""Good Works""). The success of the DL is what allowed ACM to become the #1 society, ahead of IEEE CS, and yet the DL is cheaper than most DL, especially when subscribing through a consortium.","no","not essential","While I support the idea of Open Access in principle, I find that the positions on OA are so polarized that it is impossible to have a conversation.

What we are seeing is a massive move towards Gold OA, which in my opinion is the worse possible option. We see publishers (including ACM!!) entering the game of charging both authors and readers, and we are turning scientific publishing into a vanity press. For what benefit?

Today, it is really hard to say what is the actual, measurable benefit of OA for the research community. Everybody else seems to benefit from it but the researchers: commercial publishers have a new source of income, predatory publishers live off it, industry gets free access to research results. By contrast, if my department had to pay author fees for all the papers published by its faculty, it would triple or quadruple the cost of the current subscriptions to my institution (even if we assume it would replace these subscription, which obviously is not the case today).

So I think OA is a good idea IN PRINCIPLE, but we haven't found the proper way to implement it yet. I think a reasonable solution would is the following:
1) Green OA by institutional repositories for recent publications;
2) OA to all publications that are older than a few years (3-5 years?) by the traditional publishers (including ACM).

This way, you get the funding for Green OA from research institutions for recent works and you ensure OA in perpetuity after that from the traditional publishers. And you kill Gold OA, which becomes useless. Institutions would still subscribe to the DL to get easy access to the most recent works.
","conferences","yes","yes","yes","they allow long form results;they allow one to present completed research","","Statistics from the ACM DL show that journal papers get way more downloads than conferences. In that sense, they have more impact. This is, I believe, because people from other fields trust journals more than conferences, and/or because they get lost in the number of conferences and it's hard to know their quality if you are not in the field.
I think journals still have a role in CS, to publish more mature results and to reflect on larger research efforts than those reported in conferences.","4","2","3","1","Most people do not realize that the DL is run on a shoestring.

While most academic institutions have subscriptions to services like the ACM DL, many (if not most) developers in industry do not have such access, so open access would help the transfer of ideas from academia to industry.

Finally, I think open access requires a different view of the service that publishers provide. In the Internet age, authors can distribute their papers effectively for free (by posting on their website). The critical service is the peer reviews that say a paper is worth reading and disseminating. Effectively, an acceptance through peer review is a ""seal of approval"" that acts as a filtering criterion for those looking for valuable papers in their area.

In addition, it's important to remember journals for their original intent: to preserve important scientific results. We now have electronic mediums through which we can preserve and archive our results, and disseminate them with very low cost.

True open access means access open to all for free (and at no charge for the author). And that is possible because the costs are drammatically decreasing:
- writing is done by the authros, who arealready paid for this
- reviewing is done by the research community, for free (that's part of the job), supported by free online tools (Easychair, Scienceconf, etc.)

I am happy to pay membership fees and conference fees to support ACM in those things.","yes","yes","Honestly, I am a fan of what you call Green OA. My ideal scenario:

I submit a paper to an ACM publication, it is accepted.
ACM gets a non-exclusive, perpetual license to publish my paper online in the DL.
Additionally, ACM gets an exclusive, limited-term (10-20 year) license to publish my paper in print.
I retain copyright and am free to provide my paper online, or otherwise grant license to others to publish online.

In that scenario, ACM could charge whatever it wanted for access to the DL or print publications, and I would be fine with it, because my work was still available open access via my own site or other sites. I think people would still pay for the DL, for its indexing, but not paying for the DL would not prevent finding a specific paper via google.

So to summarize: To me, people should be paying ACM as a publisher for indexing and editorial... for the convenience of having vetted, high-quality publications in one place and well organized... not for the papers themselves. The papers themselves should be freely available, but ACM certainly doesn't have to make them freely available if it doesn't want to. As the author retains copyright, it is their responsibility. Likely I would use something like arXiv. Why duplicate effort with them? There is only one Wikipedia, after all.","conferences","yes","yes","yes","they allow one to present completed research;it is expected by your employer","yes","I think they are valuable for completed research, but not necessarily more prestigious.","4","4","3","5","I think the value of the DL is the indexing and organization, not file storage. arXiv could handle that.","academia","<10 years ago","yes","SIGPLAN","North America"
